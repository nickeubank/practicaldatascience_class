The reason, again, is that the chart is being generated on the fly in the browser, so the data *has* to be available at the time of compilation.\n",
                "\n",
                "As a result, if you are making a chart from a large dataset, the resulting chart can become very large. Indeed, for this reason Altair will throw an error if you try and make a chart from a dataset with more than 5,000 rows, since doing so has the potential to generate pretty big files.\n",

But if you start to find that your jupyter notebook isn't working so well any more because these are getting big, then...\n",
                "  - Use the JSON data transformer by running `alt.data_transformers.enable('json')`. When you make a chart, this will cache the data to disk somewhere, then reference this file in the Vega-Lite JSON rather than writing all your data into the file. Then when your browser renders the chart, it will just read the data when needed. \n",
                "  - Install the `altair_data_server` (`pip install altair_data_server`) and run `alt.data_transformers.enable('data_server')`. This will do the same kind of trick as above (put a reference to your data in the vega-lite spec rather than a full copy of your data), but this does it without writing anything to disk. \n",
                "\n",
                "Note that these are good fixes if you just want to see what something looks like, or you want to generate a chart *and then save it as a PDF or PNG*. But they aren't great for sharing / hosting online because the data isn't actually being saved in your image. \n",
                "\n",
                "**If you want to share your chart / host online:**\n",
                "\n",
                "- *Share a PDF / PNG* As noted above, there are lots of easy tricks if you just want to make and then export a PDF / PNG. \n",
                "- *Collapse your data first* It's pretty rare that one can create figure can really accommodate tens of thousands of data points and retain readability. So one option is to just collapse your data first! For example, if your goal is to make a bar-chart showing the number of 911 calls by day of the week, and your dataset has one million 911 calls, just collapse your data first (e.g. one row per day of the week, with the associated number of calls for each day). \n",
                "- *Host the data at a URL* Vega-Lite specs need to have *access* to source data, but they don't have to contain it per se. Indeed, if you look at the Vega-Lite JSON spec above, you can see where it points to the source data (`\"data\": {\"url\": \"data/cars.json\"},`). So if your data is too big to put into the Vega-Lite spec for some reason, you can also host it elsewhere and provide a URL to the data. Just put the URL you want to use in `Chart()` when you make your chart!"
