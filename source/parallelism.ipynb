    "\n",
    "Before you dive into this, let me just tell you the punchline of this entire page right up front: parallelism is the **last tool** you want to turn to for speed. It is **not** a silver bullet, it will generally take you *significant* time to implement, the speed improvements from parallelism are generally **much** smaller than what you get from other performance improvement methods (see [Understanding Performance](performance_understanding.ipynb) and [Performance Solutions](performance_solutions.ipynb)), and the headaches of parallelizing code are many. \n",
    "\n",
    "## What *is* Parallelism\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallelism is the process of:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. taking a single problem, \n",
    "2. breaking it into lots of smaller problems, \n",
    "3. assigning those smaller problems to a number of processing cores that are able to operate independently, and\n",
    "4. recombining the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "As this list shows, parallelism is not easy, and so not only does it take substantial developer time (the time it takes you to implement it), but there are computer-time costs to breaking down problems, distributing them, and recombining them, often limiting the returns you will see to parallelism.

    "## Why is Paralleism important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Given all that, why is parallelism all the rage?\n",
    "\n",
    "The simple answer is that, when it comes to running a serial program (a problem where you run your code in sequence, one step at a time), processors stop getting faster in about the mid-2000s. \n",
    "\n",
    "This might surprise you. Most of us have heard that Moore's Law dictates that processors are doubling in performance every 18 months. The reality, however, is more complicated. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moore's law used to apply to a number of aspect of processors: the size of transistors, the number of transisters, and the speed that a processor executed serial code. But as shown in the figure below, processor frequency and the speed of serial execution stopped this pattern of doubling in the mid-2000s (serial execution has still been making small gains since then, but even that is iffy -- those improvements are due to little hacks that only work when programs work in just the right way). \n",

    "And so since chip makers have lost the ability to make their processors faster, they've turned to just giving us more and more processors in the form or more \"cores\": components of chips that are capable of independent operation. And leveraging the availability of massive numbers of cores (either in single machines, or for huge datasets, across lots of computers) has become the only place left to go for performance!\n"

    "## Theoretical Limits of Parallelism\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, now let's talk about the theoretical limits of parallelism. \n",
    "\n",
    "The biggest problem with parallelism is that it's very hard to break some problems into smaller pieces you can work on simultaneously. Somethings you do on computers are fundamentally *serial* / *sequential*, and thus cannot be broken up.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose you want to simulate how weather evolves over time. The only way to simulate how weather will evolve on day 2 of your simulation is to wait till you've finished simulating day 1 so you can use those results as the starting point for your simulation in day 2. That means there's no way to fully parallelize a weather simulation, since the results at time $t$ will always depend on the results generated at time $t-1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To be clear, this is not to say there are *no* opportunities to speed up weather simulations -- since you generally run weather simulations over and over and then look at the *average* prediction, each separate simulation can be parallelized. But it does mean that *even if you had infinite processors*, you couldn't bring the time it takes to simulate the weather down to zero because you'd have to finish simulating day 1 before you can simulate day 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Amdahl's Law\n",
    "\n",
    "The formalization of this idea is what's called Amdahl's Law, which gives the *theoretical* limits of parallelization. If $P$ is the proportion of your algorithm that can be parallelized, and $N$ is the number of cores available, the fundamental limit to the speed-up you can get from parallelization is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{(1-P)+\\frac{P}{N}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Which also means that even with infinite cores, you can't get past the speedup limit of:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{1}{(1-P)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressed graphically, this is:\n",
    "\n",
    "![amdahlslaw](images/amdahlslaw.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law)\n",
    "\n",
    "As this figure shows, even for a task that is *95\\% parallelizable*, the biggest possible performance gain you will ever get (with infinite cores), even ignoring any real-world overheads required to execute that parallelization is 20x. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to be clear, that doesn't mean there aren't situations where the best strategy is parallelism. If you've exhausted all your other opportunities to speed up your code, parallelism may be all that's left. And in data science, it's not uncommon to have code that can be much more than 95\\% parallelizable -- for example, if you need to run a simulation 1,000,000 times, and each run is relatively short, you can get close to 100\\% parallelizable. But the point is that parallelism is no silver bullet, and it's important to think hard about whether your problem is suited to parallelizing before you invest in trying to parallelize your code!"

    "## Vocabulary \n",
    "\n",
    "The terms processor and core are often used interchangable among computer scientists to refer to \"units capable of indepedent operation\".

    "\n",
    "![intel_chip](images/intel_chip.jpg)\n",

    "\n",
    "![core_i7](images/core_i7.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "And while most of us refer to the chip as a processor, and these cores as... cores, computer scientists have a tendency to use the term \"processors\" and \"core\" interchangeable to refer to what most of us call \"cores\". \n",
    "\n",
    "And the question of \"how many processors / cores do I have\" gets even more confusing for two reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, many desktops have two seperate chips (i.e. two Intel i7s, or two Intel i9s), leading some people to call these multi-processor machines. :/\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, many modern processors have a feature called \"hyperthreading\", which is where two tasks can be assigned to the same individual core. That core can't do both tasks at the same time, but it can try and switch between them efficiently. For example, if the first task stalls out while it's waiting to get more data from memory (remember how [slow memory is](performance_understanding.ipynb)), the core can switch to working on the second task instead of just sitting around. This *can* offer additional performance, but much less than actually having an actual additional independent core, and actual performance depends on the nature of the job being run (I've heard data science people say if two cores gets you 2x performance, then hyperthreading gets you about 1.25x performance, which seems roughly consistent with my experience. But again this depends *hugely* on the nature of the job you're parallelizing). \n",
    "\n",
    "Confusingly, though, the way hyperthreading manifests is by telling your operating system that you have two cores for every physical core on your computer. So for example, while my computer has only 8 physical cores, if I open Python and run:"

Remember because each process is it's own unique and beautiful snowflake, it doesn't know what your current Python session knows! Joblib will also pass data to these processes if your job uses data. That means that if, instead of just an index like `i`, you were passing a dataframe in as an argument, Joblib would make a new copy of your dataframe in everyone one of these processes (which means if your dataframe takes up 30% of your RAM, and you try and parallelize over 8 processes, you're run out of memory when joblib makes 8 copies!). \n",
    "3. Joblib then starts telling these processes to run your function (`run_simulation`) for different values of `i`. It takes care of making sure that all your `i` values run somewhere. \n",
    "4. Then when each process finishes running `run_simulation(i)`, it passes the results back to joblib in your primary process, and puts them in a list. \n",
    "5. Then when all values of `i` have been used, `joblib` closes all those processes. \n",

    "## Multi-processing versus Multi-threading\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of parallelism -- where we create entirely new processes to run our code, and we have to copy over our data to each new process -- is what's called \"multiprocessing\". Multiprocessing is nice because (a) you can use it on big server clusters where different processes may be running on different computers, and (b) it's quite safe. As a result, *most* parallelism you're like to encounter will be multi-processing. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is another type of parallelism to be aware of called multi-threading. In multi-threading, all the code being run (each sequence execution of which is called a \"thread\") exists within a single process, meaning that all the different threads have access to the same objects in memory. This massively reduces duplication because you don't have to copy your code and data and pass it around -- all the threads can see the same parts of memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "But multi-threading has three major shortcomings: \n",
    "\n",
    "- It is *very* easy to run into very subtle but profound problems that lead to corruption (the biggest of which is something called [Race Conditions](https://youtu.be/7ENFeb-J75k)). \n",
    "- Multi-threading can only distribute a job over the cores *on a single computer*, meaning it can't be used to distribute a job over hundreds of cores in a large computing cluster. \n",
    "- You generally can't use multi-thread parallelism in Python because of a [fundamental component of its architecture (the GIL)](https://realpython.com/python-gil). \n",
    "\n",
    "So... multi-threading isn't something you're like likely to try and implement yourself. But if you *do* need to get into multi-threading, consider jumping to a language like Julia, which allows for [easy multi-threading, complete with security features.](https://julialang.org/blog/2019/07/multithreading)\n",
    "\n",
    "But that isn't to say you may not *benefit* from multi-threading. More and more tools are implementing parallelism (even Python packages, by building in the multi-threading into the C code that underlies that package you use in Python), so you may just get some benefits for free!"

    "## GPU Parallelism\n",
    "\n",
    "Something related to general parallelism is GPU parallelism. GPU parallelism is the practice of using Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) to do *extremely* parallel computing. \n",
    "\n",
    "GPUs are basically computers onto themselves designed for the sole purpose of, as the name suggests, processing graphics. As it turns out, however, most of what one does when processing graphics is *lots* of matrix algebra. And so in recent years researchers, have started using GPUs for scientific research. \n",
    "\n",
    "GPU processors aren't \"general purpose\" processors -- they only do a few things, and as a result of that specialization, what they do they do *fast*. Moreover, they are massively parallel: while your CPU (your Intel chip) may have ~4-8 cores, a modern GPU has either hundreds or thousands of cores.\n",
    "\n",
    "But because GPUs are basically computers onto themselves, to use them you have to write special code to both manage all those cores and also manage the movement of data from your regular computer to the GPU. All of which is to say: you probably won't write your own GPU parallel algorithm, but if you end up in an area that uses them a lot (i.e. training neural networks), the libraries you use will. "

    "## Parallelism and Distributed Computing\n",
    "\n",
    "In this reading, we've mostly focused on discussing the *principles* of parallelism -- the goal, the fundamental problems, and some basic examples of parallelism. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a future class, we'll discuss some packages that are designed to make parallelism as easy as possible in situations where you really need parallelism. In particular, we'll focus on tools for *distributed computer*: situations where you don't just want to parallelize across the cores in your computer, but across many computers (e.g. in the cloud). But when we get to these tools -- like `pyspark` and `dask` -- try to keep in mind the lessons we've learned here, because everything you've learned here applies to those packages as well!"
