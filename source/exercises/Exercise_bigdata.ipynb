This data comes from the Global Historical Climatology Network, and is the actual raw data provided by NOAA. The only changes I have made to this data are a few small formatting changes to help meet the learning goals of this exercise. \n",

    "To do these excercises, first please download the data for this exercise [from here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/oq36w90hm9ltgvc/global_climate_data.zip?dl=0). Note this is a big file (this is a big-data exercise, after all), so be patient. "

    "**(2)** Thankfully, we aren't going to be working with *all* the data today. Instead, everyone should pick two weather stations to examine during this analysis (so each pair should pick 4 -- different weather stations have different data availability, so by grabbing two each hopefully at least 1 will have a long time series available...). \n",
    "\n",
    "To pick your stations, we'll need to open the `ghcnd-stations.txt` file in the directory you've downloaded. It includes both station codes (which is what we'll find in the `ghcnd_daily.csv` data, as well as the name and location of each station). \n",
    "\n",
    "When picking a weather station, make sure to pick one flagged as being in either GSN, HCN, or CRN (these designate more formalized stations that have been around a long time, ensuring you'll get a station with data that has been recorded over a longer period). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that Station IDs start with the two-letter code of the country in which they are located, and the \"NAME\" column often constains city names. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The `ghcnd-stations.txt` is a \"fixed-width\" dataset,** meaning that instead of putting commas or tabs between observations, all columns have the same width (in terms of number of characters). So to import this data you'll have to (a) read the notes about the data in the project README.txt, and (b) read about how to read in fixed-width data in pandas. When entering column specifications, remember that normal people count from 1 and include end points, while Python counts from 0 and doesn't include end points (so if the readme says data is in columns 10-20, in Python that'd be 9 through 20).

Sorry -- datasets big enough to cause big problems for people with 32GB take a long time to chunk on an 8GB computer, and these exercises have to be fast enough to finish in a class period!
