    "**Note:** Most students taking this class are Duke MIDS students who have worked with `pandas` previously. As a result, these exercises are very light on basic pandas Series and DataFrame manipulations. If you are new to `pandas`, I would advise looking into some addition practice opportunities with `pandas`, as discussed on the [Advice for Non-MIDS Students](../not_a_mids_student.ipynb) page, such as DataCamp's \"pandas Fundamentals\" course. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we're going to use data from the [American Communities Survey (ACS)](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/acs.shtml) to study the relationship betwen educational attainment and wages. The ACS is a survey conducted by the United States Census Bureau (though it is not \"The Census,\" which is a counting of every person in the United States that takes place every 10 years) to measure numerous features of the US population. The data we will be working with includes about 100 variables from the 2017 ACS survey, and is a 10% sample of the ACS (which itself is a 1% sample of the US population, so we're working with about a 0.1% sample of the United States). \n",
    "\n",
    "This data comes from [IPUMS](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/), which provides a very useful tool for getting subsets of major survey datasets, not just from the US, but [from government statistical agencies the world over](https://international.ipums.org/international-action/sample_details).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is *real* data, meaning that you are being provided the data as it is provided by IPUMS. Documentation for all variables used in this data can be found [here](https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/group) (you can either search by variable name to figure out the meaning of a variable in this data, or search for something you want to see if a variable with the right name is in this data). \n",
    "\n",
    "Within this data is information on both the educational background and current earnings of a representative sample of Americans. We will now use this data to estimate the labor-market returns to graduating high school and college, and to learn something about the meaning of an educational degree. "

    "## Getting to Know Your Data\n",
    "\n",
    "When you get a new dataset like this, it's good to start by trying to get a feel for its contents and organization. Toy datasets you sometimes get in classes are often very small, and easy to look at, but this is a pretty large dataset, so you can't just open it up and get a good sense of it. Here are some ways to get to know your data. "

    "**4)** That's a *lot* of variables, and definitely more than we need. In general, life is easier when working with these kinds of huge datasets if you can narrow down the number of variables a little. In this exercise, we will be looking at the relationship between education and wages, we need variables for: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Age\n",
    "- Income\n",
    "- Education\n",
    "- Employment status (is the person actually working)\n",

    "**5)** Now that we have a more manageable number of variables, it's often very useful to look at a handful of rows of your data. The easiest way to do this is probably the `.head()` method (which will show you the first five rows), or the `tail()` method, which will show you the last five rows. \n",
    "\n",
    "But to get a good sense of your data, it's often better to use the `sample()` command, which returns a random set of rows. As the first and last rows are sometimes not representative, a random set of rows can be very helpful. Try looking at a random sample of 20 rows (note: you don't have to run `.sample()` ten times to get ten rows. Look at the `.sample` help file if you're stuck. "

    "\n",
    "Note that our decision to only look at people who are employed impacts how we should interpret the relationship we estimate between education and income. Because we are only looking at employed people, we will be estimating the relationship between education and income *for people who are employed*. That means that if education affects the *likelihood* someone is employed, we won't capture that in this analysis.

If that were the case, we would expect employee earnings to rise with every year of high school, since in each year of high school we learn more. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, this suggests employees pay high school graduates more because they think *the kind of people* who can finish high school are the *kind of people* who are likely to succeed at their jobs.
