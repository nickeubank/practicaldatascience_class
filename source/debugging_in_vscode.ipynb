                "1. **Debug controls**. This is the main set of tools for debugging and includes the option to (a) *continue* execution until the next breakpoint is reached or if execution terminates, (b) *step over* and stop at the next line of code - doing this allows you to execute the code line-by-line, (c) *step into* a function and show the execution within that function rather than in the parent function, (d) *step out* of a child function back up to the parent function, (e) *restart* execution, and (f) *stop* execution immediately. These controls allow us to carefully navigate through a function to explore its operation. \n",
                "2. **Execution line indicator**. This tells us the next line that will be executed once execution continues.\n",
                "3. **Variable explorer panel**. This shows a list of all panels either in the local scope (e.g. the current function, in this case `factorial()`). This also lists all of the variables in the global scope, such as `num` here, which are not within any function. This may be one of the most important tools in the toolbox. We can look at each and every one of the variables in our code and as we step through the code execution, see how the variables change. We can even click on these values in this variable explorer and change them, which changes them in memory as well. This can be useful if we want to see if changing a value fixes a problem in our code, for example.\n",
                "4. **Watch panel**. This panel allows us to create custom expressions that are evaluated throughout the execution of the program to monitor them throughout. Imagine we had a function that had 1,000 variables and we only were interested in watching how a few of them changed&mdash;in this case we could add those variables to the watchlist and have them updated at each step in our debugging process.\n",
                "5. **Call stack**. The call stack shows the different functions that are run here and as the program steps into each function, the local scope is changed to that function's scope and the function is added to the call stack. If we click on the different items in the call stack, it will show us the current point of execution in each.\n",
                "6. **Debug console**. The debug console allows us to interact with the variables at any step in the execution for which execution is paused. This can be incredibly issue to diagnose potential issues in the program because it allows full interactive access to the current state of the variables in the midst of execution."
