    "In the last section, we practiced using a few tools and introduced the idea that the command line is just a way of talking to your operating system using text commands rather than by clicking on icons. In this section, we'll introduce some more advanced tools, and discuss general principles that will help you during your data science career. \n",
    "\n",
    "Like everything in this course, this section will focus on tools that are most relevant for an applied data scientist. We will not try and cover advanced bash programming (loops, function definitions, etc.), because anything you can do that way you will also be able to do in Python, for which you are receiving lots of additional training. If you want to learn those skills, there are lots of great tutorials out there (e.g. the full [DataCamp tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-shell-for-data-science)). Instead, the focus here is on skills you're likely to use when using git, managing packages in Python, or getting stuff set up on remote servers so you can run your R or Python scripts. \n",

    "In the examples below, we'll be working with the example data in the [Example_Data/command_line](https://github.com/nickeubank/practicaldatascience/tree/master/Example_Data) folder in this repository, which you can download if you wish to follow along. "

    "## Command Line Syntax: General Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed there are some patterns to how command line tools we've covered so far operate. In this section we'll introduce some general principles that are used by most command line programs (like `git`, `python`, `julia`, `conda`, `zip`, `ssh`, etc.):\n",
    "\n",
    "1:  **The first thing you type into the shell is actually just the name of a program.** This may not be obvious, but when you type `cd` and `ls`, you're actually asking your operating system to find and execute programs with those names. If you wanted to, you could actually find individual files called `cd` and `ls` that the operating system is running when you use those commands. And later on, you'll spend a lot of time using the commands `python` or `git`, which is just a way of asking the operating system to execute those programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2: **The things that come after the program being called are called \"arguments\", and they are passed to the program being called.** For example, if you were to run `python my_file.py`, you are calling the program `python` and passing it the name of a file as an argument (which it will then execute). What arguments a function accepts or requires depends on the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "3: **The shell is very sensitive to spaces.** If you have filenames with spaces, you'll need to use quotes or escape the spaces in the file names by preceding them with a `\\` (e.g. `less this\\ is\\ my\\ file.txt`).\n",
    "\n",
    "4: **Many programs have options that are activated with \"flags\"**. A flag is usually single dash followed by a single letter. For example, you can ask the `ls` function to display the contents of a directory in a list format using the flag `-l`. "

    "**One Dash Versus Two Dashes**\n",
    "\n",
    "Many flags also have a longer (easier to read) version that you call with **two dashes**. Basically, if a shell command sees one dash, it knows that *each letter* immediately afterwards is a different flag. If it sees two dashes, it knows that *everything after the dash before the first space* is a single flag name. \n",
    "\n",
    "(Two-dash options are common in modern commands, but aren't always available in older commands like `cd` and `ls`. In the early days of programming, people didn't see being \"user friendly\" as a priority). \n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, consider the `less` (move) command. If you want it to report the currently installed version, you can *either* type `less -V` (single dash followed by a single letter) *or* `less --version` (double dash followed by a full word). \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that because a single dash tells the shell that what follows is a single letter flag, you can actually pile up flags after a single dash. For example, we already know that `-l` tells `ls` to show files in a list. `-h` says to include a (human readable) file size. Since each flag after a single dash is only one letter, if we squish them together the command line knows that it's a series of one letter flags (since `lh` itself is two letters so wouldn't be a valid single flag).

    "You can re-direct the output of any program that prints something to the screen to a file with the `>` command. For example, to save the output of the `ls` command to a file on your desktop, you would type `ls > ls_output.txt`. \n",

    "### Piping\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes instead of saving the output of a program to disk, you want to pass it to another program to analyze. This practice -- using the output of one program as input to another -- is called \"piping\", and it can be very powerful (and is actually used in many programming languages, not just `bash`).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we wanted to count the number of `.csv` files in a folder. One way to do this would be to use `ls *.csv` to save the names of all the files in a directory to disk, then use the `wc` command (short for \"word count\") to count the number of lines in that file. To do so, we save the output of `ls -1 *.csv` to disk (the `-1` option forces `ls` to put one file name on each line), then point `wc` at the file using the `-l` option (which counts total lines, since if a file name has a space it would be counted as multiple words. See `man wc` for more information on how `wc` works):"

Note you can diagnose this problem by typing `which COMMANDNAME`, which will tell you the folder from which COMMANDNAME is being run.\n",

This is a small script that runs in the background whenever you open a new command line window. If you add a modification to your `PATH` variable here, that modification will always be loaded when you open a new command line session. \n",

If you haven't changed your default terminal program (i.e. haven't installed oh-my-zsh, as suggested in the [last tutorial](command_line_part1.ipynb), your configuration file will be located in your home directory (`cd ~`) and is named either `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc`. Note that the name starts with a `.` so it's invisible by default! You'll have to use your `ls -la` trick to see and open it. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you installed `oh-my-zsh`, then the file will still be located in your home directory but will now be called `.zshrc`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Configuration File on Windows**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using Windows, you can change the PATH variable globally by going to `System Preferences > Advanced > Environment Variables`. But if you're just using `bash` through `Cmder`, you should have a config file in your home Cmder home at `config/user_profile.sh`. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Actually Changing your PATH Variable**\n",
    "\n",
    "When modifying your `PATH` variable, you really don't want to remove anything already in your `PATH` variable (because who knows what program may need one of those obscure directories). Instead, the best practice is to just prefix the folders you want searched first. If you program isn't on your PATH, this will add the program; if the wrong version of a program is being used, because you're adding to the *front* of the PATH variable, the folder you add will have higher priority.  \n",
