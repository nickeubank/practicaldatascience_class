But it is a skill that takes time and energy to learn, and so in most classes — which want to focus on teaching topics like statistical analysis or programming concepts — instructors choose to provide students with clean, ready-to-use environments so everyone can focus on those topics. For example, if the MIDS Python Bootcamp included a module on setting up Python environments instead of providing you with a clean virtual machine, you'd probably end up learning ~25\\% less programming!\n",

But even more importantly, I think *everyone* who works in data science would agree that more important than picking the \"correct\" editor is becoming proficient in whatever editor you use. With that in mind, most Duke MIDS courses have decided to coordinate around VS Code to allow you the opportunity to get really, really good at VS Code. You may later decide it isn't for you, but at least this way you'll have a good sense of what a good editor can do.\n",

In addition, this will give us a chance to learn a little about how the command line works, which will be really important to effective troubleshooting.\n",

It is my **strong** recommendation that you use Miniconda. That's because if you install Anaconda from anaconda.com, you get not only Python and the conda package manager, but also dozens of pre-loaded packages. And while that sounds great, the reality is that it tends to cause lots of package conflicts once you start adding anything new to your installation. Miniconda, as the name implies, is the \"mini\" version of the Anaconda package, and basically only includes Python and a couple core utilities (conda, pip, etc.). As a result, a Miniconda installation is much less likely to cause package conflict problems down the road.\n",

And your computer is *very* protective of anything installed at the level of the operating system because of the dangers of computer viruses, so anything installed there can run into \"permission\" problems when it tries to run.

                "The first two of these will just change where conda looks for packages by default. But the last command will cause conda to swap out the version of Python 3.9 that came with miniconda (at least that was the default as of August 2022) a slightly newer Python (3.10) that was built by the folks at conda-forge. That step isn't strictly necessary, but it will ensure we're all working with 3.10, and because we're moving to a conda-forge build, it can help avoid conflicts later."
