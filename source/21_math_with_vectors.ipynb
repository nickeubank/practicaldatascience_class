    "One of the great things about vectors is that we can use them to do math in a very concise manner. For example, if you try and do a math mathematical operation between a vector and either a scalar number or another vector of length one, numpy will just repeat the mathematical operation with each entry in the longer vector (a behavior called \"broadcasting\"). This is a very valuable trick -- since we often use vectors to store a collection of measurements of the same phenomenon (e.g. the salaries of employees, the dollar value of sales, temperature measurements, etc.), it is also the case that we often want to apply the same mathematical function to all of the entries in a vector.  \n"

There are no observations in most bins, so they don't have bars you can see, but we see a bar reaching up to 1 at about 156 because there's one observation in the bin centered about there (the observation 155), a bar reaching up to 1 at 162 because there's one observation there (the observation of 162), and the bar reaches to *three* in the bin around 170 because there are three observations (170, 171, and 171) that fall in that bucket.\n",

    "2. A commonly used measure of health is a person's *resting heart rate* (basically, how low does your heart rate go when you aren't doing anything). Find the minimum heart rate you experienced over the day.\n",
    "3. A one measure of exercise intensity is your maximium heart rate -- suppose that during the day these data were collected, you are deliberately exercising. Find your maximum heart rate.\n",
    "4. Let's try to calculate the share of readings that were taken when you were exercising. First, create a new vector that takes on the value of `True` when your heart rate is above 120, and `False` when your heart rate is below 120.\n",
    "5. Now use a summarizing function to calculate the share of observations for which your heart rate was above 120!"
