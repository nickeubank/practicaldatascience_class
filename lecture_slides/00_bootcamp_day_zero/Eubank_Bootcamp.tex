\begin{frame}[c]{What is Data Science?}
\begin{enumerate}
	\pause \item What (\alert{in theory}) do we think Data Science should be?
	\pause \item What (\alert{empirically}) is Data Science?
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[c]{What (in theory) should Data Science be?}

\pause Discipline of learning how best to \alert{answer questions} using \alert{quantitative data.}

\pause
\begin{itemize}
	\item Question-first approach \\
	\pause \item The tool you use should be dictated by the question you seek to answer
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{What (empirically) is Data Science?}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{How did Data Science become a thing?}

Over the past several decades:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Availability of data $\uparrow$
	\item Computational power $\uparrow$
\end{enumerate}
\pause
$\Rightarrow$ Huge proliferation and increase in sophistication of computational methods
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[c]{How did Data Science become a thing?}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Academic research is organized into silos:
	\pause
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Computer Science
		\item Statistics
		\item Economics
		\item Political science
		\item Engineering
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\pause $\Rightarrow$ Development of new tools occurred \emph{within} each silo.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[c]{Where are we today?}
Very little cross-pollination across silos
\begin{itemize}
	\pause \item Lots of duplication of development.
	\pause \item Every silo has its own vocabulary.
	\pause \item Each silo has focused on the aspects most relevant to their applications. e.g.:
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause \item CS likes to classify things and make predictions, don't care how model works
		\item Social scientists like to make causal statements, don't care about predictive power
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{}
\pause \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{blindmenelephant.jpg}
\pause $\Rightarrow$ This is where we are \emph{now.}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{What is (empirically) Data Science?}
\pause An effort to unify the development of quantitative methods \\
\pause $\rightarrow$ Recognize the elephant
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{Why does this matter to you?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Most current researchers learned their skills in a silos. \\
	\pause In many ways, \alert{\emph{you} will have better perspective than your professors.}
	\pause \item Important not just technically, but also when it comes to advice.
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause \item Recognize that your professors' conception of ``data science'' \alert{may not match yours}.
		\pause \item Also just good life advice: scientists are \alert{very unscientific} when it comes to career advice!
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[c]{Bootcamp}

Definitely emphasizes the Software Engineering side of Data Science.

\begin{itemize}
	\pause \item Drew and Genevieve are \emph{extremely} talented software engineers, and will be providing a rigorous foundation for your future programming endeavors.
	\pause \item Even if you have programmed before, please be open to what they teach.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item LOTS of industry experience feeds into their recommendations.
		\item Great opportunity to break some bad habits.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{Bootcamp \& LLMs}
\begin{itemize}
	\pause \item It is a \emph{really} bad idea to use LLMs at this stage in your education.
	\pause \item Why? In short: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause \item For \alert{real} data science applications, LLMs are \alert{valuable but error-prone} tools and require careful supervision. 
		\begin{itemize}
			\pause \item Essentially, they are like undergraduate RAs, good at drafting code, but not fully trustworthy.
		\end{itemize}
		\pause \item But for beginner programming exercises, they are deceptively powerful, and so using them is like learning multiplication using a calculator — it deprives you of the opportunity to develop the intuitive ``number sense'' required to do advanced work.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\pause \alert{If you use LLMs now, you will never develop the skills needed to supervise them effectively for real projects!} So please don't cheat yourself.\\
\pause (More detailed memo to follow on Slack)

\begin{frame}[c]{emacs \& VS Code}
You have two editor options for Bootcamp:
\begin{itemize}
	\item emacs
	\item Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
\end{itemize}
\pause Consider talking to your TAs and older students when deciding.
