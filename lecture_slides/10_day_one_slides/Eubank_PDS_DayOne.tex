\begin{frame}[c]{What is Data Science?}
\begin{enumerate}
	\pause \item What (\alert{in theory}) do we think Data Science should be?
	\pause \item What (\alert{empirically}) is Data Science?
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[c]{What (in theory) should Data Science be?}

\pause Discipline of learning how best to \alert{answer questions} using \alert{quantitative data.}

\pause
\begin{itemize}
	\item Question-first approach \\
	\pause \item The tool you use should be dictated by the question you seek to answer
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{What (empirically) is Data Science?}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{How did Data Science become a thing?}

Over the past several decades:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Availability of data $\uparrow$
	\item Computational power $\uparrow$
\end{enumerate}
\pause
$\Rightarrow$ Huge proliferation and increase in sophistication of computational methods
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[c]{How did Data Science become a thing?}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Academic research is organized into silos:
	\pause
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Computer Science
		\item Statistics
		\item Economics
		\item Political science
		\item Engineering
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\pause $\Rightarrow$ Development of new tools occurred \emph{within} each silo.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[c]{Where are we today?}
Very little cross-pollination across silos
\begin{itemize}
	\pause \item Lots of duplication of development.
	\pause \item Every silo has its own vocabulary.
	\pause \item Each silo has focused on the aspects most relevant to their applications. e.g.:
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause \item CS likes to classify things and make predictions, don't care how model works
		\item Social scientists like to make causal statements, don't care about predictive power
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{}
\pause \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{blindmenelephant.jpg}
\pause $\Rightarrow$ This is where we are \emph{now.}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{What is (empirically) Data Science?}
\pause An effort to unify the development of quantitative methods \\
\pause $\rightarrow$ Recognize the elephant
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{Why does this matter to you?}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Most current researchers learned their skills in a silos. \\
	\pause In many ways, \alert{\emph{you} will have better perspective than your professors.}
	\item Important not just technically, but also when it comes to advice.
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause \item Recognize that your professors' conception of ``data science'' \alert{may not match yours}.
		\pause \item Also just good life advice: scientists are \alert{very unscientific} when it comes to career advice!
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[c]{This Class}
Part 1: Everything that comes \emph{before} analysis
\begin{itemize}
	\pause \item Importing data of lots of forms
	\pause \item Cleaning dirty data and developing practices to protect yourself
	\pause \item Merging data from different sources
\end{itemize}
\pause $\rightarrow$ Start to finish wrangling portion of data science project.\\
\vspace*{0.2cm}
\pause Part 2: Picking tools
\begin{itemize}
	\pause \item Developing an \emph{answerable} question
	\pause \item Understanding how your question dictates the best tool to use.
	\pause \item Plan your project using backwards design
\end{itemize}
\pause $\rightarrow$ Develop a research question and outline a full project.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{This Class}
By the end of this class:
\begin{itemize}
	\pause \item Find and organize data \emph{on your own}.
	\pause \item Understand how different tools relate to one another.
	\pause \item Know how to approach organizing a full project.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{But... What about Python?}
\pause
Don't worry. We'll do lots of Python (esp numpy \& pandas). \\
\pause But many of the take-aways aren't Python specific.\\
\vspace*{0.5cm}
\pause For students who are struggling with (vanilla) Python:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The books we will use include Python refreshers,
	\item All students will have full access to DataCamp if they want it,
	\item I can provide additional resources.
\end{itemize}
\pause (But this class doesn't pick up where Drew left off) \\
\vspace*{0.2cm}
\pause \alert{My job is to meet you where you are.}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{About Me}
	I am a social scientist \\
	\vspace{0.5cm}
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause \item PhD in Political Economy
		\pause \item Master in Economics
		\pause \item BA in Economics and Political Science
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{My Research}
	\begin{itemize}
		\pause \item Looking for evidence of polling place manipulation in North Carolina
		\pause \item Developing methods of measuring Gerrymandering in the US.
		\pause \item Testing theories about how social networks shape political behavior using cell-phone meta-data to map social networks of entire countries (Zambia and Venezuela).
		\pause \item Studying whether political elites in the US South turned to using incarceration to prevent black voters from exercising political influence after the Voting Rights Act removed their ability to use Jim Crow restrictions.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[c]{What that means for you}
\pause I've worked with \emph{a lot} of messy data in many contexts. \\
\pause I have unusually broad exposure to data science:
\begin{itemize}
	\pause \item Within academic circles, I've worked with economists, statisticians, computer scientists, and political scientists.
	\pause \item I've done \alert{policy consulting} (World Bank, Center for Global Development), \alert{public outreach} (Op-Ed in \emph{The Guardian}), and \alert{legal consulting} (various voting rights cases).
\end{itemize}
\pause \emph{If} this sounds like your ``flavor'' of data science, I'm happy to talk about career options in this domain.
