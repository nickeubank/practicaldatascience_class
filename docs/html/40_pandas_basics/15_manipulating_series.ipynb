    "Extracting a subset of elements from a Series is an extremely important task, not least because it generalizes nicely to working with ever-larger datasets (which are at the heart of data science). This process—whether applied to a Series or a dataset—is often referred to as \"taking a subset\", \"subsetting\", or \"filtering\". If there is one skill that is key for enhancing your data science skills quickly, it's this, because this allows you to get your data into the right format for processing as quickly as possible.\n",
