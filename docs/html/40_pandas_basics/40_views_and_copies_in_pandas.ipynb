    "## Copy on Write\n",
    "\n",
    "Views were implemented in numpy as a way of improving performance. Arrays are often very large objects, and creating new copies of those objects every time one subsets or modifies an array takes a lot of computer time (and memory).\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, however, by tying the fates of apparently distinct arrays, views are also an easy way to inadvertently corrupt your data. Moreover, while there are consistent rules about when you get a view and when you get a copy *in numpy*, for technical reasons pandas has never managed to make consistent promises. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, this *is* a way to (generally) get both speed *and* predictability with arrays, and that is with Copy on Write (CoW).\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of Copy-on-Write is that, from the perspective of the user, `pandas` behaves *as if* all operations return a copy. Thus, from the user's perspective, one need never worry about changing one array and have the effects of those change unintentially propagate. \n",
    "\n",
    "But behind the scenes, `pandas` doesn't actually make copies as soon as the user does something like subset a DataFrame; instead, if it can `pandas` will create a view (so it's faster) and make a note that if either the original array or the subset are ever changed, it needs to actually make the copy before allowing those changes to take place.\n",
    "\n",
    "The beauty of this solution is that it recognizes that views and copies look the same to the user right up until the user tries to edit the values in one array (\"write\" a change into the data). So by not making a copy until it's absolutely necessary, `pandas` can get by using views whenever possible!\n",
    "\n",
    "(Copy-on-Write, it should be noted, is not unique to pandas—it is the default in some other languages like R)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### An Example\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate how CoW works, let's do a simple example and talk through what's going on behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we'll enable CoW. This will become the default behavior in pandas, but for now you have to run this command in each Python session. Personally, I've just written a little shortcut to add this below `import pandas as pd`.\n"
