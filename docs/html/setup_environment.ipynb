    "## 1. Installing A Basic Text Editor\n",
    "\n",
    "One tool you will find incredibly helpful in your career as a data scientist is a good text editor designed to work with plain text files (files that just contain simple text, but no fancy formatting like a Microsoft Word document or a PDF). You've probably seen a simple version of this type of editor before (Notepad on Windows, or TextEdit on macs), but is really useful to install a more robust text editor instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this purpose I'm going to recommend Visual Studio Code (better known as VSCode). It's a Microsoft project, but it's open source and in addition to being an easy way to edit plaintext files comes with a lot of packages for adding extra functionality. VSCode is definitely not the only good text editor out there, and you'll find that people have very strong opinions about which one to use (some people swear by in-terminal editors like eMacs, or Vim), and personally I used to rely on Atom (since github -- which developed Atom -- was bought by Microsoft, it looks like a lot of the development energy has moved over to VSCode, so I think that's a better place to go now...). If you already have one of these and like it, please feel free to stick with it!\n",
    "\n",
    "So before we install Python, please follow the directions below to install VSCode if you don't already have a good text editor."

    "## 2. Installing Python and conda\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike a programming language like R, Python doesn't have an internal system for installing and updating packages. Instead, we will need to install a dedicated Python package manager (which will also install Python itself).\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the Python ecosystem, there are two main package managers: `conda` and `pip`. Among data scientists, conda is by far the preferred choice. That's because while both conda and pip do a good job installing Python packages, conda is also capable of installing a wide range of binary dependencies that are often required for data science packages (e.g. `geos` for geospatial work, `igraph` for network analysis, etc.). Indeed, you can even do things like install R through conda. Moreover, as long as you install packages from a specific provider in conda (something will discuss how to do below), conda does a really good job of avoiding package conflicts. Of course, you will sometimes find conda doesn't have a package you need, in which case you can use `pip` without problems, but in general I recommend starting with conda. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of the first thing we need to do is install conda. Is there two ways to do this: the first is to install the Anaconda distribution, which includes both the conda package manager *and* a ton of commonly used packages; the second is to install `miniconda`, which only installs Python and the conda package manager. I strongly recommend the second option (miniconda) because in my experience having a ton of packages preinstalled causes lots of package conflicts down the road.\n",
    "\n",
    "So to install Python, go to the [miniconda Download page](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), download and install the most recent Python 3.x version of miniconda (as of Oct 2020, this was Python 3.8). (On a Mac, the `Pkg` installer is easier to use) using the installation instructions for your operating system detailed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation for Mac Users\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, miniconda will install itself into your home folder. Except that and don't try to install it in the custom location!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation for Windows Users\n",
    "\n",
    "When asked whether you want to install for \"Just Me\" or \"All Users\", pick \"Just Me\".\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the checkboxes during the Windows installation is \"do you want to add Anaconda to your PATH?\". Select Yes. I know they discourage it, but it allows miniconda to work well with Cmder. \n",
    "\n",
    "### If there's a Python 3.8, why is there also a Python 2.7 available?\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2000, Python 3 was first released. Python 3 fixed a lot of things people disliked about Python, but in the process it made some changes that meant code written in Python 2 would not work any more. To ease the transition to Python 3, both Python 2 and Python 3 have been supported for several years so people could keep running their Python 2 projects while they finished the transition. Almost everything is now in Python 3, so since you don’t have any old code to worry about, you want Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deleting conda\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the really nice things about conda is that it keeps everything in a single folder, including conda, Python, and all the packages you install. As a result, if you ever need to delete your conda installation (whether it's Anaconda or miniconda), all you have to do is delete your folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is good to know because a lot of the troubleshooting advice you will get from the Internet when you have problems with packages is to just delete your installation and start again. In fact, if you already have a pre-existing anaconda or miniconda installation, I would actually recommend that you delete it and install a clean version using the instructions above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the exact version of conda you have installed, your installation will live in a folder that is called Anaconda3 or miniconda3 that is located in your home directory (`c:\\\\users\\<your username>\\` on Windows or `/users/<your username>/` on macs), or in `/opt/` (if you installed \"For all users\"). To delete your current installation, just delete that folder!"

    "## 3. Using miniconda with Your Command Line Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some directions for making sure that you can use conda with your command line tool of choice!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Windows Users using Cmder\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're [using Cmder as suggsted](bash_on_windows.ipynb)... you're done! :) Congratulations. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Using conda with Oh-My-Zsh\n",
    "\n",
    "If you installed Oh-My-Zsh during the command line exercises ([as suggested here](command_line_part1.ipynb), then miniconda won't work right away. The problem is that when you install miniconda, it adds some code to the `.bash_profile` file in your user directory that makes conda visible to your bash session by adding it to your PATH variable (jump to the PATH variable section of the [Advanced Command Line](command_line_part2.ipynb) reading if that doesn't sound familiar).\n",
    "\n",
    "But Oh-My-Zsh doesn't run the `.bash_profile` file when it opens; it runs the `.zshrc` file. So what we have to do is move the code Anaconda put in `.bash_profile` into `.zshrc`. You can do this as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open `.bash_profile` and copy the block of text  that begin with `# >>> conda init >>>` and ends with `# <<< conda init <<<`. You have `VSCode` now, so you can do this by openning your Terminal, and running `code ~/.bash_profile` (which will open your `.bash_profile` file in VSCode).\n",
    "2. Then open `.zshrc` (again, `code ~/.zshrc`), scroll to the bottom of the file, and past the text you copied from `.bash_profile` into `.zshrc`.\n",
    "3. Save that file, close your current session of Oh-My-Zsh, open it again, and test to see if you were successful by typing `conda -h`. If a conda helpfile gets printed out, you're good!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If you copy text from the nano editor (rather than open your file with `code`) and the nano editor window is narrow, the ends of lines will be truncated when you paste the output (and will end with dollar signs (`$`)).\n",
    "\n",
