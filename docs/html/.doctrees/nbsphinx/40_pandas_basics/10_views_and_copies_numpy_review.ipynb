    "In our discussion of numpy in Course 2 of this specialization, we discussed detail how, when one subsets an array, what numpy returns is often not an entirely new array, but rather a *view* of the original array. These views share the underlying data of the array from which they were spawned, meaning changes to either the original array or the view have the potential to impact one another.\n",

    "It's worth pausing for a moment to point out a bit of a problem with the language of views and copies. It is common, in numpy circles, to look at the example above and talk about `my_vector` being the original data, and `my_subset` as a view. And it is true that, because `my_vector` came first, there is a difference between `my_vector` and `my_subset` in terms of how numpy is creating and managing these objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "But from your perspective as a user, it is important to recognize that there is a *symmetric dependency* between `my_vector` and `my_subset` in the example above. Yes, one may be \"the original,\" but once a view has been created, changes to *either* array have the potential to propagate to the other: changes to the `my_subset` may resultant changes to `my_vector`, and changes to `my_vector` can impact the `my_subset` (if they impact the portion of the array referenced by the subset).\n",
    "\n",
    "So when you think about views, always remember that what we're talking about is *multiple objects sharing the same data*, even if we tend to only talk about one of our arrays as \"a view.\""

    "\n",
    "While a full discussion of the rules of when numpy returns a view and when it returns a copy is a little too complicated to fit into this review reading, just a reminder that not *all* numpy subsets are views. For example, if you subset an array with \"fancy indexing\" (e.g. passing a list of indices—`my_array[[1, 2]]`—instead of a range of sequential indices separated by a colon as we did above), you will always get a copy. We cover this in detail in Week 3 of Course 2 of this specialization, and you can also find a [summary in the official numpy documentation here](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/basics.copies.html)."
