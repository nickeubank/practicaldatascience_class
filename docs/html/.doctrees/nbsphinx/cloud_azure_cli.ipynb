    "In our past tutorials, we mostly manipulated our Azure resources using the Azure web interface, but once you get comfortable with Azure, you'll likely find this a little clunky for some things. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, Azure *also* has a Command Line Interface (CLI)! In addition to letting you manage all your resources, it can also help you managing things like data uploads or downloads (so you don't have to navigate to your Container in your browser). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure CLI is easy to install using the directions for your operating system [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then all authorization is managed by just running `az login` -- that'll open a login in your browser which will then authorize your session for whatever you want to do!\n",
    "\n",
    "The only catch is that if you want to login to a different \"tenant\" within your account (e.g. if you have an account with free student credits AND the ability to use resources billed to your company or school), you have to specify your tenant (e.g. `az login --tenant <tenant>`). You can find your tenant ID by going to portal.azure.com, selecting \"Azure Active Directory\", and looking at your Overview tab.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Then you can basically do anything you can do through the web interface from the command line! [You can find a great quickstart guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/get-started-with-azure-cli) for an overview of how it all works. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Managing Storage with Azure CLI\n",
    "\n",
    "The one set of tools within the Azure CLI I *will* make sure to point out are tools for uploading and downloading data. There's [a tutorial here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-quickstart-blobs-cli), but the basic syntax is very simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Upload Data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "az storage blob upload \\\n",
    "    --account-name <storage-account> \\\n",
    "    --container-name <container> \\\n",
    "    --name helloworld \\\n",
    "    --file helloworld \\\n",
    "    --auth-mode login\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Download Data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "az storage blob download \\\n",
    "    --account-name <storage-account> \\\n",
    "    --container-name <container> \\\n",
    "    --name helloworld \\\n",
    "    --file ~/destination/path/for/file \\\n",
    "    --auth-mode login\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(Though note that doing so requires adding a \"role\" to your account to authorize this behavior. This is discussed below, and the CLI will also give you directions if you don't have the relevant role)."

    "## Moving Lots of Data?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Azure CLI is a good tool, but if you're moving data around a lot, here's an even better tool that may be worth your investment: AzCopy. It's a little less friendly to setup than the Azure CLI, but its much more powerful. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we often have folders of data we want to mirror on Azure, use for computations, then when we're done running some calculations, we might want to bring the updated version of the folder back to our computer. Rather than moving data file by file with Azure CLI, or even just copying the data all together, we can use `azcopy` to *sync* the two folders -- you just point at the folder you want to sync, and it will synchronize the contents across platforms, transfering only the data that's actually different between two folders (like `rsync`, if you know what that is!)\n",

    "\n",
    "**Mac**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a terminal session and type `echo $PATH`. Confirm that `/usr/local/bin` is one of the files listed. \n",

    "3. Drag `azcopy` into that folder. \n",
    "4. Apple doesn't initially trust this program so before you close the folder, right-click on `azcopy` and select \"Open\". You'll get a warning, and say \"Open Anyway\". \n",
    "5. Now open a new terminal session and type `azcopy -h` to make sure the install worked. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Linux** \n",
    "\n",
    "See above, but skip step 4. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Windows**:\n",
