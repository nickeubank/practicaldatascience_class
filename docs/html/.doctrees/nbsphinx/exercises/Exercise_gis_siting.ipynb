    "# Locating a New Grocery Store\n",

    "\n",
    "To aid in your analysis, we will be working with a dataset of *all* retail food stores in New York provided by the NY Department of Agriculture and Markets. The source for the [data is here](https://data.ny.gov/Economic-Development/Retail-Food-Stores/9a8c-vfzj), but please work from the copy of the [data here](https://github.com/nickeubank/practicaldatascience/blob/master/Example_Data/gis_siting/ny_retail_food.zip). We will use this data to identify areas that are under-served by grocery stores today (e.g. to find market opportunities).\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, it's not enough to know where grocery stores currently are or are not -- if it were, we could just advise our client to put some grocery stores out in the middle of no where! So we'll also be using some demographic data from the US American Communities Survey (downloaded from NHGIS). You can find that [data here](https://github.com/nickeubank/practicaldatascience/blob/master/Example_Data/gis_siting/ny_census_blockgroups_2019.zip). This is all public data, and as such is not nearly as detailed as data you can buy from marketing professionals, but even so you'll see we can get a lot of value from it. "

Grocery, as a search term, catches a lot of delis and bodegas, which aren't really in competition with Whole Foods.\n",

But we *don't* know how close those people are to an existing grocery store! So let's use the data we've now created to gather information about what communities may currently be under-served by local grocery stores!\n",

    "Note that distance you get from this operation will be in meters because of how our data is being represented (it's projection -- something we'll read about for our second GIS class).\n",

To do so, calculate the population density of each census block group and drop any census block groups with population densities below 100 people per square kilometer (bearing in mind that the units of this map are meters, so `.area` will return an area in meters squared).

That can cause problems here -- because there may be MULTIPLE competitors in the same block group you can end up with block groups being duplicated. Since we only care about the *distance* to the nearest competitor (not whether there are multiple at distance 0), drop these duplicates. Your observations should be unique on `[\"STATEFP\", \"COUNTYFP\", \"TRACTCE\", \"BLKGRPCE\"]`. "

If this were a real consulting gig, we could ask Whole Foods for data on their current customers, but for the moment let's just assert that they tend to be wealthy and highly educated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our census data already has a variable with median household income (`md_hh_inc`). Now also construct a variable the gives us the share of people over 25 in each Block Group that have at least a Bachelors Degree.

These's no obvious way to balance these considerations, but for the moment let's look for places where the share of people with college degrees is over 50%, median household income is over $90,000, and the nearest competitor's grocery store is more than 8km away, and the nearest Whole Foods is over 8km away.\n",

    "Rather than measuring the distance to the nearest grocery story, let's look at the number of grocery stores within 15km of each block group.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we'll begin by using `buffer()` to expand each block group outward by the buffered distance. Then we can do a spatial join of these *expanded* polygons with our \"other grocer\" dataset. \n",

    "\n",
    "Bear in mind that each block group is unique identified by `\"STATEFP\", \"COUNTYFP\", \"TRACTCE\", \"BLKGRPCE\"`. Also note you won't be able to groupby with your geometry columns in there, so you'll need to do a groupby with a subset of columns, then merge your results back in."
