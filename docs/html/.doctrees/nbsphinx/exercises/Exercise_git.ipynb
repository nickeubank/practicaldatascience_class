    "## Part 0: Change your default editor!\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, when git needs you to label a commit, it will open an editor called [vim](https://www.vim.org/) that is very hard to work with (it's not just weird -- it's even hard to get out of once it's openned!)\n",
    "\n",
    "So before you do anything else, first change your default editor. You can do this with the command: \n",
    "\n",
    "`git config --global core.editor \"COMMANDTOLAUNCHYOUREDITOR\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have Atom installed *and the command line tool setup* (i.e. you set up Atom so that if you type `atom` in the command line, Atom opens, [as discussed here](../atom_text_editor.ipynb)), then I would do:\n",
    "\n",
    "`git config --global core.editor \"atom\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "If not, then the best option is probably to use `nano`, which is an in-terminal editor we've discussed [before](../command_line_part2.ipynb) that's much easier to use than vim, and which you should already have if you're using a bash console:\n",

    "## Part 1: Making a New Repo!\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, we will create a repository where we will use data from the World Development Indicators to quickly plots GDP per capita against infant mortality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(1)** On Computer A, go to github and create a new repository \"GDP_and_CO2\". When creating the repository, also make sure to add a README file. \n",
    "\n",
    "**(2)** Go to `Settings` and add the user of Computer B as a collaborator. That will empower you to access and work with the data in the repository from either computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "**(3)** Create a local copy of the repository on your Computer A using `git clone` and the URL provided for cloning your repository. Note that you **cannot** just use the URL for your repository's webpage! If you use that, when you push and pull you'll be trying to push and pull to a webpage, not to a git server. The URL you need for cloning should end in `.git`. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note*: Cloning a repository on github is one of two ways of getting a repository setup on your computer. The other option is to make a folder on your computer, make it a git repo with the command `git init`, add some files and commit then, go to github, create an empty repository, add that repository's URL to as the \"remote\" address in the repository on your computer using `git remote add origin www.github.com/[path to your repo].git`, then pushing. This is good to know in case you already have a repo with a lot of files on your computer. But if you're starting a new, empty repo, it's much easier to use `git clone`, since cloning also ensures that your repo knows the URL of the github repository it should connect to when doing `git push` and `git pull`. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Note*: The folder you have now cloned *is* your git repository. Everything from the level of the folder you just cloned down is part of that repository, so don't put anything into that folder you don't want in the repository. And don't put other repositories into that repository!\n",
    "\n",
    "**(4)** Now that you've cloned your repository, on Computer A edit the `README.md` file by adding some text about the project. Then `git add` those changes, `git commit`, and push. Check on github to ensure that your edits are evident there. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note you can edit your `README.md` file any way you want! You can use Atom, nano, or any other editor. `README.md` is just a text file on your computer you can work with like any other text file. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2: Making a Pull Request\n",
    "\n",
    "As you've read, a common way to work with a github repository is to create *branches* where you develop new code. Creating a *branch*, as the name implies, is a way of creating a version of your repository that *branches* off from the master branch at a point. Once created, a branch exists indepedently of the master branch so that you can make edits to your code without worrying about interfering with anyone else who wants to use the master branch. This is useful in software (since people may be running the master branch), but it's also often useful in data science (where you may be experimenting with changing how variables are defined, and won't want that to impact other people till you've decided what you want to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you're done working on a branch, you may decide that the changes you've made are amazing, and you want to merge those changes back into the master branch (you also may not! It's always ok to throw away a branch that didn't work! Branches are for experimenting safely). \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to ensure that only *good* code ends up in the master branch, it is common practice when working on teams to not just merge you branch back into the master branch. Instead, you submit a \"Pull Request\" on github, which is basically a request (on github) for other people to come review your code. Pull requests, in other words, are primarily a mechanism for peer review. So let's make our first pull request (common referred to as a PR)!\n",
    "\n",
    "**(5)** Still on Computer A, let's create a new branch we can experiment on. We can do this in one of two ways: \n",
    "\n",
    "- We can type `git branch <new_branch_name>` (to create the branch), then `git checkout <new_branch_name>` to switch to that branch, or\n",
    "- We can type `git check -b <new_branch_name>` to **both** create a new branch and switch to that branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Switching\" branches means that git (potentially) changes what files are visible to your computer and operating system. Because our new branch is, well... new, it still looks exactly the same as our master branch, so you won't see any changes in your files. If you're using Cmder on windows or Oh-My-Zsh on a Mac, though, you can see what branch your on by looking at your command line prompt. It should move from showing \"master\" to your new branch name (here: \"my_new_branch\") when you switch: \n",
    "\n",
    "![branch_change_in_terminal](../images/branch_change_in_terminal.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now any changes you make and commit to the files in your repository will be *changes made to the active branch*, not to master.\n",
    "\n",
    "**(6)** Still on Computer A, let's start writing some analysis code! Before we start, though, an important note: Git is only really build for simple, plaintext files, so please don't use Jupyter Notebooks (we'll discuss that in more detail below). You can use text files you edit and work with in Jupyter Lab, but not notebooks. For a refresher on how to use text files in Jupyter Lab (in a manner analogous to RStudio) see [JupyterLab Exercises](Exercise_jupyterlab.ipynb). \n",
    "\n",
    "OK, so now let's create a regular Python (`.py`) analysis file in our repository. If you're using Jupyter Lab, just create a new textfile, save it into the  repository folders, then get to work (right-click the text file, select \"Create Console for Editor\", then select Python 3 to create a kernel where you can run your code as you work). \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, import World Develoment Indicators from this url using `pd.read_csv`: https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/nickeubank/MIDS_Data/master/World_Development_Indicators/wdi_small_tidy_2015.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "Then pull out the columns: \n",
    "\n",
    "- 'Mortality rate, infant (per 1,000 live births)'\n",
    "- 'GDP per capita (constant 2010 US$)'\n",
    "- 'Country Name'\n",
    "\n",
    "and plot mortality against GDP per capita. "

That's because you created your new branch *locally*, but it doesn't exist yet on github. Follow the directions for telling github to make a branch to receive your push, then push again. \n",
    "\n",
    "**(8)** Now in your browswer, navigate to the repository on github. There, switch over to your new branch:\n",

    "![switch_to_new_branch](../images/switch_to_new_branch.png)\n",
