    "You've been asked by a colleague to help them figure out why they're having issues with a package they wrote. The packages designed to compare two sentences, figure out how many words they have in common, and then return the word that (a) appears in both sentences, and (b) when more than one word appears in most sentences, identify the word in both sentences with the most total occurrences. \n",

    "\n",
    "The result would be the word \"of\" (it appears in both, and appears 3 times in total).\n",

    "Note that when you run this file from the command line (e.g. navigate to where it's located and run `python debugger.py`), the first thing executed are the three test cases under `if __name__ == \"__main__\":`. As you can see, these all call `word_counter`, so you should start your examination there.\n",
