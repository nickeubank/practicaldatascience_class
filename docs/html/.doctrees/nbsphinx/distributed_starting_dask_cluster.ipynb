    "The easiest way to get a dask cluster on the cloud, in my view, is through a service called coiled.io. It's a private company that was actually created by the folks who wrote dask precisely with the goal of making it easier to start dask cloud clusters. Basically just created an account at [coiled.io](https://www.coiled.io/), and install their conda package, run their setup wizard from the command line to link your cloud account with AWS or Google Cloud, and you're all set. This is occasionally a _little_ buggy (nothing worse than managing the admin side of cloud services, is there?!), but pretty smooth.\n",
