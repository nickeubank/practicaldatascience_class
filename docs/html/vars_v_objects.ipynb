    "In Python, one of the most important concepts to understand is that there is a difference between *variables* and the *objects associated with those variables*. This idea is common to many programming languages, but not languages like R or Matlab, so this is on place people new to Python often get into trouble!\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, variables and the objects they point two actually live in two different places in your computer. As a result, in Python it's best to think of variables as *pointing* to the objects they're associated with, rather than *being* those objects. Personally, I've always liked the analogy of your computer being a big warehouse, and variables are just the entries in the inventory book used by the warehouse manager: the variable tells you how to find the thing you want, but it is not the thing itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "So when you create a new list, Python puts that list somewhere in memory, kind of like how you might put something big on a shelf in a warehouse. The variable associated with that list (say, ``my_list``) actually just stores the *location* of the shelf where that list was placed. And because this behavior is normal in most languages, you may not see it emphasized in Python tutorials written by programmers not coming from R.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason this matters is that it's possible for multiple variables to be pointed at the same object. As a result, changes made to an object though one variable will impact what you get if you call the other variables pointed at that object! For example:"
