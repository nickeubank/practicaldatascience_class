    "It's probably good to start by answering the question: What *is* the command line?\n",
    "\n",
    "The command line is a tool for talking to your operating system (e.g. macOS, Windows, etc.) using text instead of by moving around a mouse and clicking on things. Just as you can use your mouse to open folders, move and rename files, and launch programs, so too can you use the terminal to ask you operating system to do the same things. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get into the details of the terminal, though, a note on terminology: there are *lots* of names that float around that basically mean the same thing, including terminal, shell, command line, and bash. In this tutorial, the specific program we will be using is called `bash`. But if you're working on a Mac, you'd never know you were using `bash` because Apple calls bash `Terminal`. Also, `bash` is based on a program called `shell`, so you may also hear the term `shell` used to describe the tool we'll be using today. But for all intents and purposes, the terms `bash`, `command line`, `Terminal`, and `shell` are basically interchangeable on a mac or linux computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're using `bash` because it's the default terminal program on nearly all Macs and Linux computers (the operating systems of Mac and Linux computers are very similar, and are often just referred to as POSIX computers). That's important, because almost all computers in the cloud run Linux (including not just companies like Amazon Web Services, but also university research clusters). And if you want to work directly with a computer in the cloud, you will almost never get to use a pretty graphical user interface, so you'll *have* to use a terminal, making `bash` a great choice to learn on. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The one place this equivalence breaks down is on Windows.** By default, Windows does not use `bash`, but instead one of several windows-specific tools (like `CMD` or `PowerShell`) to allow this kind of text-based interaction with your operating system. But to make life confusing, these will also often be referred to as \"the terminal\" or \"command line\". Thankfully, we can install `bash` on Windows! So, **IF YOU ARE USING WINDOWS, GO TO THIS [PAGE FOR DIRECTIONS ON MAKING BASH AVAILABLE ON WINDOWS!](bash_on_windows.ipynb)** before starting any exercises."

    "- `terminal`: sometimes used colloquially to refer to any system that lets you talk to you computer via text, but also the name Apple uses when you run `bash`. \n",
    "- `DOS` and `CMD`: Window's version of `bash` and `shell`. Same purpose, different syntax. "

    "## Why Should I Learn The Command Line?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main reasons to learn to use the command line. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **More tools are available through the command line than through graphical user interface.** It turns out that it takes a lot of work to make a program that has pretty icons and windows that pop up, so lots of people make tools but don't bother to make pretty graphical interfaces. This is especially true for free and open-source software. So by learning to use the command line, you gain access to *lots* of powerful tools that would otherwise be unavailable. For example, you basically *have* to use the command line* to:\n",
    " - install and manage packages in many programming languages like Python and Julia\n",
    " - connect to research servers for working with big computer clusters for advanced data analysis\n",
    " - manage git repositories\n",
    "2. **You won't always have a graphical interface.** If your work ever requires you to use a remote server with, say, more computing power, those systems probably won't offer a graphical user interface. \n",
    "3. **Sometimes you want to do something OVER AND OVER.** Renaming a file by clicking on it, deleting the name, typing in a new name, and hitting return is great if you only need to rename one file. But what if you want to rename hundreds? The command line gives you the ability to write little scripts to do this kind of work for you. "

    "Now that you have a sense of what the command line is about, I recommend you try out [this tutorial (\"Introduction to Shell for Data Science\")](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-shell-for-data-science) to get some experience working with it (the command line is used enough that people have already created great tutorials -- I won't insult their work by trying to re-create them). If you would prefer a DataCamp alternative, you can try the first three modules of the [Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/) course on this topic, though I don't think it's quite as good. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first section of that tutorial (\"Manipulating Files and Directories\") is *free* (though you do have to create an account) and will give you a pretty good introduction. If you *want* you can keep going and get better at manipulating files and things in the command line, but that's not usually a first-order need. \n",

That's why I recommend installing a slightly nicer program like [Oh My Zsh!](https://ohmyz.sh/) that causes your terminal to offer slightly more information than the default shell, especially if you use git.
