    "## What *is* an Altair Chart?\n",
    "\n",
    "This may sound like a bit of an odd question to even ask -- it's it just an image?! -- but in the case of Altair, it turns out the answer is a little more complicated than you might think. \n",
    "\n",
    "Altair actually sits on top of a rather large stack of software libraries. Altair itself is actually just a Python wrapper for a visualization library called [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/), which is itself a simplified interface for [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/), which in turn is built on top of [D3](https://d3js.org/), a low level JavaScript visualization library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, *most* of that isn't your problem, but it is helpful to know that when you create an Altair chart, what you're *actually* generating is a JSON-formatted Vega-Lite specification for your chart. For example this chart:\n",
    "\n",
    "![vegalite_line](images/vegalite_line.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Is actually represented by this JSON file:\n",

    "and this is then compiled into an image by javascript code *in your browser* (or in your Jupyter Notebook) to create the image you see!\n",
    "\n",
    "This is important to know for a couple reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "The first is that this is the reason we need a second library -- `altair_saver` -- to save charts as PNGs, PDFs, or other image formats. If you have a chart and just run `chart.save()`, you can only save it as a JSON file or as an HTML document -- we need a different library to actually render the chart into a savable image. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second reason is that these Vega-Lite specifications **include the data used to make the chart**. The reason, again, is that the chart is being generated on the fly in the browser, so the data *has* to be available at the time of compilation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, if you are making a chart from a large dataset, the resulting chart can become very large. Indeed, for this reason Altair will throw an error if you try and make a chart from a dataset with more than 5,000 rows, since doing so has the potential to generate pretty big files.\n",
    "\n",
    "### If you want to make a chart from a large dataset...\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several workarounds, depending on your use-case. \n",
    "\n",
    "**If you're just exploring your data:** \n",
    "\n",
    "There are three pretty simple workarounds: \n",
    "\n",
    "- The first is to just turn off this warning and ignore the problem by running `alt.data_transformers.disable_max_rows()`. If your data isn't huge, this is just a good hack. But if you start to find that your jupyter notebook isn't working so well any more because these are getting big, then...\n",
    "  - Use the JSON data transformer by running `alt.data_transformers.enable('json')`. When you make a chart, this will cache the data to disk somewhere, then reference this file in the Vega-Lite JSON rather than writing all your data into the file. Then when your browser renders the chart, it will just read the data when needed. \n",
    "  - Install the `altair_data_server` (`pip install altair_data_server`) and run `alt.data_transformers.enable('data_server')`. This will do the same kind of trick as above (put a reference to your data in the vega-lite spec rather than a full copy of your data), but this does it without writing anything to disk. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that these are good fixes if you just want to see what something looks like, or you want to generate a chart *and then save it as a PDF or PNG*. But they aren't great for sharing / hosting online because the data isn't actually being saved in your image. \n",
    "\n",
    "**If you want to share your chart / host online:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Share a PDF / PNG* As noted above, there are lots of easy tricks if you just want to make and then export a PDF / PNG. \n",
    "- *Collapse your data first* It's pretty rare that one can create figure can really accommodate tens of thousands of data points and retain readability. So one option is to just collapse your data first! For example, if your goal is to make a bar-chart showing the number of 911 calls by day of the week, and your dataset has one million 911 calls, just collapse your data first (e.g. one row per day of the week, with the associated number of calls for each day). \n",
    "- *Host the data at a URL* Vega-Lite specs need to have *access* to source data, but they don't have to contain it per se. Indeed, if you look at the Vega-Lite JSON spec above, you can see where it points to the source data (`\"data\": {\"url\": \"data/cars.json\"},`). So if your data is too big to put into the Vega-Lite spec for some reason, you can also host it elsewhere and provide a URL to the data. Just put the URL you want to use in `Chart()` when you make your chart!"

    "As we noted in the last reading, it will often be the case that it's easier to just do any transformations of your data *before* passing the data to Altair (in part because of the Altair data size issues noted above). But with that said, in data exploration it's often really nice to have some quick convenience transformations, and Altair does not disappoint. \n",

    "Similarly, Altair also offers a few in-line data transformations, such as `transform_regression()` and `transform_loess()` which we saw in our last reading. The full set are [available here](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/transform/index.html). Many of these are things I can't imagine you'd ever want in place of a simple pandas data manipulation (things like \"filter\" (subset) or \"sample\" (take a random sample), which are so easy to do in pandas), but there are a couple I like for exploratory data analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [transform_regression](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/transform/regression.html#user-guide-regression-transform): fit any one of lots of regression models to your data (though no included standard errors! :( [Feel free to thumbs up request to add!](https://github.com/vega/vega/issues/3289)).\n",
    "- [transform_loess](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/transform/loess.html#user-guide-loess-transform): fit a non-parametric regression model to your data (again, no standard errors :( ).\n",
    "- [transform_density](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/transform/density.html#user-guide-density-transform): super useful for kernel densities to characterize data!\n",
    "- [transform_quantile](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/transform/quantile.html): Good for Q-Q plots. \n",
