<p>In these exercises, we’ll be practicing creating and contributing to projects using the “Github Flow” workflow you can <a class="reference external" href="https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/">find summarized here</a>. Note this is not the only workflow out there – different companies or groups will often develop their own modification of this basic strategy – but most are pretty similar to this approach.</p>
<p>In these exercises, for the first time we’ll want to use the computers of BOTH people working in each pair, so label one computer as Computer A, and one as Computer B.</p>
<div class="section" id="Part-0:-Change-your-default-editor!">
<h2>Part 0: Change your default editor!<a class="headerlink" href="#Part-0:-Change-your-default-editor!" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>By default, when git needs you to label a commit, it will open an editor called <a class="reference external" href="https://www.vim.org/">vim</a> that is very hard to work with (it’s not just weird – it’s even hard to get out of once it’s openned!)</p>
<p>So before you do anything else, first change your default editor. You can do this with the command:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">config</span> <span class="pre">--global</span> <span class="pre">core.editor</span> <span class="pre">&quot;COMMANDTOLAUNCHYOUREDITOR&quot;</span></code></p>
<p>If you have Atom installed <em>and the command line tool setup</em> (i.e. you set up Atom so that if you type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">atom</span></code> in the command line, Atom opens, <a class="reference internal" href="../atom_text_editor.html"><span class="doc">as discussed here</span></a>), then I would do:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">config</span> <span class="pre">--global</span> <span class="pre">core.editor</span> <span class="pre">&quot;atom&quot;</span></code></p>
<p>If not, then the best option is probably to use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">nano</span></code>, which is an in-terminal editor we’ve discussed <a class="reference internal" href="../command_line_part2.html"><span class="doc">before</span></a> that’s much easier to use than vim, and which you should already have if you’re using a bash console:</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">config</span> <span class="pre">--global</span> <span class="pre">core.editor</span> <span class="pre">&quot;nano&quot;</span></code></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="Part-1:-Making-a-New-Repo!">
<h2>Part 1: Making a New Repo!<a class="headerlink" href="#Part-1:-Making-a-New-Repo!" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To begin, we will create a repository where we will use data from the World Development Indicators to quickly plots GDP per capita against infant mortality.</p>
<p><strong>(1)</strong> On Computer A, go to github and create a new repository “GDP_and_CO2”. When creating the repository, also make sure to add a README file.</p>
<p><strong>(2)</strong> Go to <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Settings</span></code> and add the user of Computer B as a collaborator. That will empower you to access and work with the data in the repository from either computer.</p>
<p><strong>(3)</strong> Create a local copy of the repository on your Computer A using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">clone</span></code> and the URL provided for cloning your repository. Note that you <strong>cannot</strong> just use the URL for your repository’s webpage! If you use that, when you push and pull you’ll be trying to push and pull to a webpage, not to a git server. The URL you need for cloning should end in <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.git</span></code>.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: Cloning a repository on github is one of two ways of getting a repository setup on your computer. The other option is to make a folder on your computer, make it a git repo with the command <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">init</span></code>, add some files and commit then, go to github, create an empty repository, add that repository’s URL to as the “remote” address in the repository on your computer using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">remote</span> <span class="pre">add</span> <span class="pre">origin</span> <span class="pre">www.github.com/[path</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">your</span> <span class="pre">repo].git</span></code>, then pushing. This is good to know in case you already
have a repo with a lot of files on your computer. But if you’re starting a new, empty repo, it’s much easier to use <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">clone</span></code>, since cloning also ensures that your repo knows the URL of the github repository it should connect to when doing <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">push</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">pull</span></code>.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: The folder you have now cloned <em>is</em> your git repository. Everything from the level of the folder you just cloned down is part of that repository, so don’t put anything into that folder you don’t want in the repository. And don’t put other repositories into that repository!</p>
<p><strong>(4)</strong> Now that you’ve cloned your repository, on Computer A edit the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">README.md</span></code> file by adding some text about the project. Then <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">add</span></code> those changes, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">commit</span></code>, and push. Check on github to ensure that your edits are evident there.</p>
<p>Note you can edit your <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">README.md</span></code> file any way you want! You can use Atom, nano, RStudio, Jupyter Lab, or any other editor. This is a <strong>critical</strong> thing to understand about git and github: it is a system for <em>managing your files</em>, not for managing your entire workflow. You still edit and run your code the way you always have. In this case, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">README.md</span></code> is just a text file on your computer you can work with like any other text file.</p>

<div class="section" id="Part-2:-Making-a-Pull-Request">
<h2>Part 2: Making a Pull Request<a class="headerlink" href="#Part-2:-Making-a-Pull-Request" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As you’ve read, a common way to work with a github repository is to create <em>branches</em> where you develop new code. Creating a <em>branch</em>, as the name implies, is a way of creating a version of your repository that <em>branches</em> off from the master branch at a point. Once created, a branch exists independently of the master branch so that you can make edits to your code without worrying about interfering with anyone else who wants to use the master branch. This is useful in software (since people may
be running the master branch), but it’s also often useful in data science (where you may be experimenting with changing how variables are defined, and won’t want that to impact other people till you’ve decided what you want to do.</p>
<p>Once you’re done working on a branch, you may decide that the changes you’ve made are amazing, and you want to merge those changes back into the master branch (you also may not! It’s always ok to throw away a branch that didn’t work! Branches are for experimenting safely).</p>
<p>In order to ensure that only <em>good</em> code ends up in the master branch, it is common practice when working on teams to not just merge you branch back into the master branch. Instead, you submit a “Pull Request” on github, which is basically a request (on github) for other people to come review your code. Pull requests, in other words, are primarily a mechanism for peer review. So let’s make our first pull request (common referred to as a PR)!</p>
<p><strong>(5)</strong> Still on Computer A, let’s create a new branch we can experiment on. We can do this in one of two ways:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>We can type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">branch</span> <span class="pre">&lt;new_branch_name&gt;</span></code> (to create the branch), then <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">checkout</span> <span class="pre">&lt;new_branch_name&gt;</span></code> to switch to that branch, or</p></li>
<li><p>We can type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">checkout</span> <span class="pre">-b</span> <span class="pre">&lt;new_branch_name&gt;</span></code> to <strong>both</strong> create a new branch and switch to that branch.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>“Switching” branches means that git (potentially) changes what files are visible to your computer and operating system. Because our new branch is, well… new, it still looks exactly the same as our master branch, so you won’t see any changes in your files. If you’re using Cmder on windows or Oh-My-Zsh on a Mac, though, you can see what branch your on by looking at your command line prompt. It should move from showing “master” to your new branch name (here: “my_new_branch”) when you switch:</p>
<p><img alt="branch_change_in_terminal" src="../_images/branch_change_in_terminal.png" /></p>
<p>Now any changes you make and commit to the files in your repository will be <em>changes made to the active branch</em>, not to master.</p>
<p><strong>(6)</strong> Still on Computer A, let’s start writing some analysis code! Before we start, though, an important note: Git is only really build for simple, plaintext files, so please don’t use Jupyter Notebooks (we’ll discuss that in more detail below). You can use text files you edit and work with in Jupyter Lab, but not notebooks. For a refresher on how to use text files in Jupyter Lab (in a manner analogous to RStudio) see <a class="reference internal" href="Exercise_jupyterlab.html"><span class="doc">JupyterLab Exercises</span></a>.</p>
<p>OK, so now let’s create a regular Python (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.py</span></code>) analysis file in our repository. If you’re using Jupyter Lab, just create a new textfile, save it into the repository folder, then get to work (right-click the text file, select “Create Console for Editor”, then select Python 3 to create a kernel where you can run your code as you work).</p>
<p>In particular, import World Develoment Indicators from this url using <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">pd.read_csv</span></code>: <a class="reference external" href="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/nickeubank/MIDS_Data/master/World_Development_Indicators/wdi_small_tidy_2015.csv">https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/nickeubank/MIDS_Data/master/World_Development_Indicators/wdi_small_tidy_2015.csv</a></p>
<p>Then pull out the columns:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>‘Mortality rate, infant (per 1,000 live births)’</p></li>
<li><p>‘GDP per capita (constant 2010 US$)’</p></li>
<li><p>‘Country Name’</p></li>
</ul>
<p>and plot mortality against GDP per capita.</p>
<p><strong>(7)</strong> Once you’re done, add and commit the new analysis file (from in your command line session). Then push these files to github.</p>
<p>When you try and push them to github, you will be told that you can’t push them because there’s no branch on github to receive the push. That’s because you created your new branch <em>locally</em>, but it doesn’t exist yet on github. Follow the directions for telling github to make a branch to receive your push, then push again.</p>
<p><strong>(8)</strong> Now in your browswer, navigate to the repository on github. There, switch over to your new branch:</p>
<p><img alt="switch_to_new_branch" src="../_images/switch_to_new_branch.png" /></p>
<p>And look for the “Pull Request” button:</p>
<p><img alt="new_pr_button" src="../_images/new_pr_button.png" /></p>
<p><strong>(9)</strong> This should take you to a Pull Request screen where you can title your PR and add comments. In the comments, ask the person who has Computer B to review your PR (you can use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&#64;</span></code> and their user name to address them. So type <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">&#64;otheruser</span> <span class="pre">would</span> <span class="pre">you</span> <span class="pre">please</span> <span class="pre">review</span> <span class="pre">this?</span></code>. Then click “Submit Pull Request”.</p>

<h2>Part 3: Reviewing a Pull Request<a class="headerlink" href="#Part-3:-Reviewing-a-Pull-Request" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong>(10)</strong> Now on Computer B, navigate to the repository from your browser. You should now be able to see your partner’s PR.</p>
<p>From Computer B, <em>review</em> the PR from Computer A. You can do this on two levels:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Click on the “Files Changed” tab to see what code is being added or changed in this PR. You can also add comments here: click the plus sign that appears when you mouse over a number and leave a comment about a specific line of code (like “you need more comments to explain this code!”).</p></li>
<li><p>You can also pull this branch so you can run it on your own computer.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>(11)</strong> Let’s try the second startegy. On Computer B, clone the repository.</p>
<p><strong>(12)</strong> Navigate (from the command line) into the now cloned repository. By default, you should be on the master branch.</p>
<p>Remember when I said that switching branches changes the files visible to the operating system? Open your repository folder using your operating system (File Explorer or Finder) and look in it. If you’re on the master branch, you won’t see the new analysis file.</p>
<p><strong>(13)</strong> Now, from the command line, swith to the branch you’re reviewing for the PR (it should already be there, so you just have to do <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">git</span> <span class="pre">checkout</span> <span class="pre">&lt;branch_name&gt;</span></code>.</p>
<p><strong>(14)</strong> Now look at the folder using File Explorer or Finder again – see how the analysis file has appeared? Open it in Jupyter Lab on Computer B and see if you can get it to run.</p>
<p><strong>(15)</strong> Now go back to github and the PR, and suggest one change for the person who wrote the original code to make.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="Part-4:-Revising-a-Pull-Request">
<h2>Part 4: Revising a Pull Request<a class="headerlink" href="#Part-4:-Revising-a-Pull-Request" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Updating a PR is no different from changing any project in github – just open your files, edit your code, then add, commit, and push your changes, and the changes manifest in the PR.</p>
<p><strong>(16)</strong> On Computer A, make the changes suggested by the Computer B reviewer. Add, commit, and push those changes.</p>
<p><strong>(17)</strong> On Computer B, look to see that those changes are present, then click “Merge this PR”! Now if you look at the master branch of your repository, you should see that the analysis file now appears on <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">master</span></code>.</p>
