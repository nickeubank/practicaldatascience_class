    "Extracting a subset of elements from a Series is an extremely important task, not least because it generalizes nicely to working with ever-larger datasets (which are at the heart of data science). This process&mdash;whether applied to a Series or a dataset&mdash;is often referred to as \"taking a subset\", \"subsetting\", or \"filtering\". If there is one skill that is key for enhancing your data science skills quickly, it's this, because this allows you to get your data into the right format for processing as quickly as possible.\n",

And when we do that, the new Series of booleans will have the same index as the old Series, so they align naturally. Look back at our example of `was_busy`: you'll see that it automatically got  the same index as our original Series, `attendance`. As a result, the first row of our boolean Series will have the same index value as the first row of our original Series, the second row of our boolean Series will have the same index value as the second row of our original Series, and so on. As a result, there's no difference between matching on row order and matching on index value. But it does *occassionally* come up (like if you tried to re-sort one of these), so keep it in mind!\n"

    "As discussed above, because Series have both an order of rows, and labels for each row, you should always think carefully about which method of subsetting you are invoking. My advice: **Always using the `.loc` (for index labels) and `.iloc` (for row numbers) selectors. If you use these, the *only* surprising behavior to watch out for is that `loc` will align on row numbers if you pass a list or array of booleans with no index.** But since you *can't* align on an index in that case, there's no alternative behavior you would be expecting in that situation.\n",

    "However, there is another way to subset Series that is a little... stranger. In an effort to be easier for users, `pandas` allows subsetting using *just* square brackets (without a `.loc` or `.iloc`). With just square brackets, `pandas` will do different things depending on what you put in the square brackets. *In theory* this should always \"do what you want it to do\", but in my experience it's a recipe for errors. With that in mind, I don't suggest using it, but I will detail how it works here so you know. If this makes your head swim, just remember: **you can always use `loc` and `iloc`. Single square brackets do not offer any functionality you can't get with `.loc` or `.iloc`.**\n",
