Let's not get ahead of ourselves—even on my several-year-old on my Intel-based Macbook Pro, creating those subsets with fancy indexing (and thus using copies) may have been a lot slower than with simple indexing, but even with a vector with one million entries, each subset still took less than a millisecond.\n",

So if I'm ever uncertain about whether I should use of you or a copy in a given circumstance, I will almost always just throw in a `.copy()`.\n",

And some of you students may very well end up doing high performance work (say, climate modelling, or high-frequency trading) where this type of performance difference does matter, and so that's why it's there!\n",
