    "# Numpy Arrays: The Workhorse of Data Science"

    "The time has come for us to introduce the workhorse that makes nearly all data science in Python possible: the `numpy` `array`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A Little History\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was invented in the early 1990s to be an accessible, general purpose programming language. As part of that philosophy, it was designed to minimize the amount of \"developer time\" (the time a programmer actually spends writing code) required to complete a project, rather than to minimize \"running time\" (the amount of time a program runs). This was done, in part, because at the time programmers who needed code that ran fast already had access to the C and Fortran programming languages, languages which remain the gold standards for speed even today, but which are relatively hard to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "The design choice was clearly a good one, as it explains much of the success of Python today—yes, Python may *run* more slowly than C for most things, but many programmers are happy to accept that in exchange for being able to write and iterate their Python code much faster than they could in other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting in the late 1990s and early 2000s, however, a group of developers realized that it might be useful for programmers working in Python to have access to libraries they could do high-performance numerical computing—doing matrix multiplication, factoring, generating random numbers, etc. They hoped that this would allow data analysts (this was long before the term \"data science\" was a thing) to benefit from the ease-of-use and interactivity of Python when writing code while also making it possible to get speed when they needed it for big mathematical operations. And so to make this possible, they created a new third-party library that could be loaded into Python called Numeric, which later became `numpy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The numpy array\n",
    "\n",
    "While numpy includes lots of functions and ancillary data structures, **the** heart of the numpy library is the *numpy array.* \n",
    "\n",
    "Like the lists and dictionaries we've already seen, arrays are an object for collecting and organizing lots of individual records -- what's sometimes referred to as a *collection*. Unlike lists and dictionaries, however, which can store nearly anything you want to put into them, arrays are *homogeneously typed*, meaning that each array is designed to store a specific type of data, and can *only* store that type of data. An array of integers, for example, can only store integers, and an array of floating point numbers can only hold floating point numbers. \n",
    "\n",
    "While this may initially seem like it makes arrays inferior to more flexible collections, like lists, there is a major upside: this specialization makes arrays *fast* -- as in orders of magnitude faster -- and it is this speed that makes data science in Python possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "And as we'll see in future readings, arrays make possible a style of programming called *vectorized programming* that not only tends to be very fast, but also makes the kind of programming we do a lot in data science especially concise and easy-to-read. And if you know any linear algebra, you'll also see that this way of programming results in code that looks more like the math of linear algebra, which many data scientists find really appealing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays come in many forms, but there are two specific types of arrays whose names will be familiar: when an array organizes its data along a single dimension, we call it a *vector*, and when its data is organized along two dimensions (like how data is laid out in an Excel spreadsheet), we call it a *matrix*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the time when doing data science, these are actually the only two kinds of arrays you are likely to encounter, and so they will be the focus of the following several readings. However, as we'll see towards the end of this course, there isn't really anything different about working with arrays in three, four, or more dimensions; everything you learn in these first few lessons will generalize easily to all arrays. \n"

For example, in a previous module, we used the command `import math` to gain access to functions like `sqrt()`.\n",

    "But there are two things that are a little different about numpy from the libraries we've used before. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, numpy is what's called a *third-party library*, meaning that you don't automatically get it when you install Python. Instead, you have install the numpy library before it can be used. numpy has already been installed in the version of Python you have access to here on coursera, but if you are working with Python on another computer, you'll need to install it using a tool like `pip` or `conda` -- we have a reading on installing third party packages here [we'll need obviously!].\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, because we will be working with numpy a lot, we don't want to have to type out `numpy.` every time we access a numpy function. Instead, it is common practice to give numpy as alias (a different name) by typing: `import numpy as np`. Once we do that, we can access functions from the numpy library with the prefix `np.` instead of `numpy.`:"

In a later lesson we'll talk more about the exact reasons that numpy is so fast, but before we dive in to learning numpy, it's worth taking a moment to illustrate just how impressive numpy is!\n",

    "\n",
    "**Note:** to measure how long each of these operations takes, we will use the `time()` function from the `time` module in the Python standard library. When run, `time()` returns the current time measured in the number of seconds that have passed since January 1st, 1970 UTC -- something called \"[Epoch time or UNIX time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).\" (*Why* is time measured using the number of second since 1970?! 🤷‍♂️ Basically it turns out to be helpful for all computers to measure time against a common benchmark, and 1970 is around the time when the UNIX operating system came online.) So if we record the time before we start running our code, then record the time when the code finishes, then the difference is the amount of time (in seconds) that the code took to run. This isn't the way to do really accurate code timing -- for that you would want to run your code over and over and calculate the average running time -- but it's more than sufficient for our purposes!"

    "**Note 2:** In the following examples, I print my output using *f-strings*. f-strings were added to Python in 2017, and provide an alternate syntax for inserting the value of a variable into a string (\"string interpolation\"). They work the same was as the `.format()` method of string interpolation (e.g. `\"my name is {}\".format(name)`), but instead of putting `.format()` at the end of the string, you simply prefix your string with an `f` or `F` and place the name of the variable you want interpolated inside the curly braces (e.g. `f\"my name is {name}`). And as with the `.format()` method, you can also tell Python how to format the string with codes you pass inside the `{}`—for example, the `:.3f` that follows `python_total` below tells Python that it should print the number with only three decimal values. There's a [whole mini-language](https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatspec) for telling Python how to convert numbers into strings, but for now it's enough to know that the colon and stuff that follows are just for formatting.
