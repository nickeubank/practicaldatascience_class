    "One frequntly used measure of inequality is the Gini Coefficient. The Gini Coefficient takes on a value of 1 when the distribution of some variable is maximally unequal across a population, and a value of 0 when it is evenly distributed. We will calculate the Gini Coefficient for income inequality in our data. \n",
    "\n",
    "To visualize the Gini Coefficient, we plot the cumulative share of the population (ordered from poorest to richest) on the x-axis, and cumulative share of income earned by that group on the y-axis. The Gini Coefficient is then defined as $$\\frac{A}{A + B}$$, where the areas A and B are labeled below: \n",

    "If income is evenly distributed, then the poorest 20% of a population will also have 20% of the wealth; the poorest 40% will have 40% of the wealth, and so forth, resulting in a perfect 45 degree line. In this situation, there is no area between the 45% line and the actual income distribution, so $A=0$, and the Gini Coefficient is 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "If, by contrast, the top 10% of people hold all the wealth in a country, then there will be no wealth for the poorest 90% of people, then wealth will jump up at the far right side of the graph. This will generate a very large gap between the 45% line and actual income for most of the graph, generating a large value for the area $A$, creating a very high Gini Coefficient. \n",

    "The result we just generated offers a snap-shot of inequality for this subset of countries. But what are the dynamics of inequality for these countries?\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an idea in economics called the \"convergence hypothesis\", which argues that poorer countries are likely to grow faster, and as a result global inequality is likely to decline. Economists advocating for this hypothesis pointed out that while rich countries had to invent new technologies in order to grow, many poor countries simply had to take advantage of innovations already developed by rich countries. \n",
